The data is then provided to a pre-built React front-end that provides options as to where to launch it's campaign. This project will allow mock launch campaigns, display all upcoming campaigns with the ability to abort a launch and a history page to show all campaigns and their status. 

This project is ongoing as a attempt to get more familiar with Nodejs on a quest to be a backend engineer.
