# SpaceProgram

Project is using keplar archived space data contained in a CVS file. This file is streamed in and used to filter data to find what is considered a potential habitable planet. The data is then provided to a pre-built React front-end that provides options as to where to launch it's campaign. This project will allow mock launch campaigns, display all upcoming campaigns with the ability to abort a launch as well as a history page to show all campaigns and their status. 

This project is ongoing as a attempt to get more familiar with Nodejs on a quest to be a backend engineer using the ZTM selflearning platform. The first phase of the project is complete but there is still more to do like adding authentication and cleaning things up. Currently this project is using a MongoDB database with mongoose connecting it to our node server.

Even though this is still fairly new to me and I need a lot more practice to get used to everything, it has been a great learning experience.
